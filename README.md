# nxc_bruter
nxc_bruter is a lightweight Bash utility for testing credentials across multiple network services using nxc/NetExec. Designed to streamline password spraying, brute-force authentication, and credential verification, nxc_bruter automatically loops through your specified services and passes file-based credential lists directly to nxc.
